# Conventions

> **Template — filled during bootstrap.** Only rules that are real: every rule here should be
> either enforced by tooling (preferred) or checked in review. Aspirations don't belong here.

## Language
<!-- Set at bootstrap (step 0) and mirrored in AGENTS.md. Changing it later is allowed — edit both
     places; existing documents are not translated retroactively. -->
- Chat language (interviews, sessions): <!-- e.g. Turkish -->
- Document language (docs/, specs, plans, ADRs, review and verify reports): <!-- e.g. Turkish -->
- Always English (protocol, not prose): ANEW core files, template headings and field labels,
  `Status:` values (Draft / Approved / In progress / Shipped), `Approved by / on:`, `Source:`.
- Code identifiers, branch names, commit messages: <!-- default English; decide consciously -->

## Language & framework versions
<!-- Pin what matters. -->

## Naming
<!-- Files, types, tests, branches — whatever the team must keep consistent. -->

## Error handling
<!-- The one blessed pattern. What never leaks to users. -->

## Data rules
<!-- e.g. money/percentages use decimal types; timestamps are UTC; IDs are ... -->

## Enforced by tooling
<!-- List what the compiler/linter/analyzers already enforce, so review doesn't re-litigate it.
Wire new rules into `scripts/check` whenever possible — prose is advice, tooling is law. -->
